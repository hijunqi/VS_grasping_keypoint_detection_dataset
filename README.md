# VS_grasping_keypoint_detection_dataset

This dataset is in COCO format for robotic iamge-based visual servoing (IBVS) grasping using keypoint detection. It contains real-world samples and synthetic samples generated using domain randomization in the Unity 3D engine.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset is organized into the following structure:

images/ - Contains RGB images of objects captured from different views, backgrounds, and foregrounds for the training set

val/ - RGB images for the test set

train_coco.json Annotation file for the training set

val_coco.json Annotation file for the test set

README.md - Overview of the dataset structure and contents
