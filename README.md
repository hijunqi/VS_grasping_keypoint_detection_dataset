This dataset contains images, annotations, and visual servoing data for robotic grasping using keypoint detection and image-based visual servoing (IBVS) control.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset is organized into the following structure:

images/ - Contains RGB images of objects captured from different views
val/ - Contains keypoint annotations for objects in JSON format
train_coco.json includes (x,y) coordinates for each annotated keypoint
val_coco.json includes (x,y) coordinates for each annotated keypoint
